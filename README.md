# Music-Search-and-Generation
In this data project, we develop algorithms to
1. Predict music character labels (such as danceability, instrumentalness, valence, etc) based on a subset of labeled data
2. Train a music generator based on RNN to create new music tracks with user-specified music character.
Data is obtained from the Free Music Archive, and it can be found at https://github.com/mdeff/fma.
